    "### What is Chatbot?\n",
    "Chatbots are consersational programs that automate interactions. They are artificial intelligence (A.I) softwares designed to simulate conversation with human users typically through text or voice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "    - A chatbot on a bank's website that helps with enquires\n",
    "    - A chatbot on an e-commerce site that tracks orders or provides recommendations\n",
    "    - Virtual Assistants like **Siri** and **Alexa**."

    "### B. Difference Between Chatbots and Bots\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chatbots** are a sunset of bots. They are specifically designeed for conversation, meaning they are programmed to interact using natural language processing (NLP) to simulate human conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bots**, on the other hand are more general-purpose programs designed to automate tasks. They don't necessarily interact, but they perform specific functions like web scraping, sending reminders or managing social media post.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chatbot**: Focuses on conversation(e.g., answering customer queries).\n",
    "- **Bot**: Focuses on automating repetitive tasks(e.g; posting scheduled tweets)."

    "### C. Tpyes of Chatbots\n",
    "**1. Rule-Based Chatbots**: \n",
    "- They follow specific set of instructions or rules. It works by looking for specific keywords or patterns in what you say and then picking the correct response from its list.\n",
    "- The problem is if you ask something it wasn't programmed for, it might get confused or give a response that doesn't make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Retrieval-Based Chatbots**:\n",
    "- They are bit smater than rule-based ones. Instead of giving fixed reply, they search through a bunch of pre-written reponses and try to find the best one based on what you said. It's like going through a library to find the book that mostly answers your question\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Techniques Used**: \n",
    "  - Jaccard Similarity: Imagine you ask question like, \"What's the weather today?\" The bot checks which of its stored answers have the most words in common with your question. The more words they share, the more likely it is to pick that answer.\n",
    "  - Cosine Similarity: This is like comparing two texts using math. It turns your words into numbers and checks how similar they are. If the numbers line up, the bot figures that the answer might be a good fit.\n",
    "  - **Machine Learning Models like `Naive Bayes`**: This is where the bot starts to guess what you're talking about, learning from past examples. If it's trained to answer questions about sports, it'll know that when you ask about \"Football\", it should probably give a sports-related response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Generative Chatbots**:\n",
    "- They are the most advanced chatbots. Instead of pulling from a list of pre-written answers, they create their own reponses based on what you said. It's like having a conversation with someone who thinks on the spot and makes up their answers.\n",
    "- However, they need a lot of training to get good at answering questions. They use models like RNNs, LSTMs"

    "# **D. Common Terms in Natural Language Processing (NLP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "NLP is a ways for computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language. With NLP, computers can read, listen and even reply like  humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Tokenization\n",
    "Tokenization is breaking down a sentence into smaller pieces that a computer can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Lemmatization**\n",
    "Lemmatization is when the computer changes word to their simplest form, called the **Lemma**. For example, the word \"running\" Changes to \"run\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Stemming**\n",
    "Stemming is when the computer cuts off the ends of words to get the base form, or **stem**. For example, \"Playing\", \"Played\", and \"Played\" all become \"Play\". This is different from lemmatization because it chops off word endings. Stemming helps computers group words with similar meanings together by choppings off extra endings.#\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Stopwords**\n",
    "Stopwords are very common words, like \"the\", \"is\", \"and\", \"in\" that computers often ignore when analyzing a sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Corpus**\n",
    "A **Corpus** is a large collection of written or spoken text that computers use to learn and analyze language. It's like giving the computer lots of books to read and study from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Bag of Words (BOW)**\n",
    "Is a simple way for computers to represent text. It works by counting how many times each words appears in a text, without caring about the order of the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**\n",
    "TF-IDF is a more advanced version of **Bag of Words**. It doesn't just count how often a word appears in a text (like BOW), it also checks how rare or important that word is across many documents."
